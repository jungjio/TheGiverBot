# TheGiverBot


This is only for mac users currently, if I get more support or if anyone is willing to upload an exe for it, I'll have it linked here.

Bot needs a few things to get started up.
  One of which is a google driver.
  Download link: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started
  
  Leave the chrome driver inside your downloads folder,
  this allows you to work with the software in the code.


# BYPASSING CAPTCHA
Prior to pressing buy on the bot, when you run the code you will be prompted to 2 windows. Create a new tab on the popped up Chrome browser, and log into a valid google account. Then use the 2nd tab to solve captchas, so that Google can recognize you are a valid google id. After completing however many captchas you want, you can buy the items you want, when clicking buy.




# CURRENT ISSUES

Supreme is doing a good job tracking down bots, and as of right now this bot doesn't work.
