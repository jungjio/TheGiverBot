This is only for mac users currently, if I get more support or if anyone is willing to upload an exe for it, I'll have it linked here.

Bot needs a few things to get started up.
  One of which is a google driver.
  Download link: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started
  
  Leave the chrome driver inside your downloads folder,
  this allows you to work with the software in the code.
